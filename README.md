# Vulnerability Scanner - Main File

This is the main file for a simple vulnerability scanner. It currently checks for SQL injection, Clickjacking, and Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) vulnerabilities. However, it needs further improvements to work correctly.

## Instructions

1. Run this script by executing `python main.py`.
2. Enter the URL you want to scan for vulnerabilities.
3. The script will scan for SQL injection, Clickjacking, and IDOR vulnerabilities.
4. The results will be displayed on the console.

# Vulnerability Scanner - Scanning Functions

This file contains various scanning functions for detecting common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, Clickjacking, and Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR). These functions are used in the main vulnerability scanner but may require further improvements to work correctly.

## Vulnerability Scanners

1. `scan_url(url)`: Scans for SQL injection vulnerabilities in the provided URL.
2. `click_jack(url)`: Checks for Clickjacking vulnerabilities.
3. `scan_idor(url, user_input)`: Scans for Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR).
4. `scan_xss(url, custom_payloads)`: Scans for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities with custom payloads.

## Issues and Improvements

These scanning functions provide basic detection but may have limitations. The following improvements can be made:

- Enhanced XSS scanner with more payloads and better detection.
- Improved SQL injection detection for more accurate results.
- Enhanced Clickjacking detection to cover all scenarios.
- Thorough testing and improvements in IDOR detection.

This file can serve as a starting point for building a more robust vulnerability scanner. Contributions and enhancements are welcome.
